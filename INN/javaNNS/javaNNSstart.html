<P>The <I>Java Neural Network Simulator (javaNNS</I>) is a simulator for neural networks developed at the 
Wilhelm-Schickard-Institute for Computer Science (WSI) in T&uuml;bingen, Germany.  For more information, see the
main <a href="http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS/">SNNS web-site</a>. 

<P>This page contains the necessary information to get <I>javaNNS</I> up and running on The University of
Birmingham's School of Computer Science Linux PCs.  All commands should be entered into the standard
Linux terminal window. 

<p>The simulator is probably best run with JDK-1.4.2 which you can configure using: 

<p><ul><tt>setup java/JDK142</tt></ul>

Then to configure <I>javaNNS</I> itself you should use the command:

<p><ul><tt>setup java/NNS</tt></ul>

<p>The <I>javaNNS</I> setup script copies a config file to your home directory (JavaNNS.properties) to set 
browser preferences and the location of the HTML documentation.

<p>To save having to run these commands every time, you can add them to the other setup commands in 
your ~/.login file so they are run automatically.

<p>Before you start running the simulator, you would be wise to create a new sub-directory in your 
home directory to keep all your files associated with it:

<p><ul><tt>mkdir ~/NNS</tt></ul>

<p>and then move into that directory using:

<p><ul><tt>cd ~/NNS</tt></ul>

<p>Now you ready to start up <I>javaNNS</I> using the command:

<p><ul><tt>javaNNS &amp; </tt></ul>

<p>The interface provided is very intuitive, but to use <I>javaNNS</I> effectively you are advised to 
take a look at my <A HREF="javaNNSguide.html">Quick Guide to <I>javaNNS</I></a>
and make good use of the on-line help function.

<p>For your convenience, I have placed all the 
<a href="javaNNSexamples">examples files here</a>, so you can easily 
copy the ones you need into your own file space to play with. 

<p>If you want to install <I>javaNNS</I> on your own computer, you can easily download versions for Linux, Windows, and 
Macintosh systems from the <A HREF="http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/JavaNNS/"><I>javaNNS</I> download site</a>.
