			   </i>
               <p>I shall be
				giving a speech about the current and most common deficiencies in
				programming languages. An attempt will be made to sum up the problems
				arising from traditional programming and their implications in computer
				security. Two case studies shall be presented in order to demonstrate the
				need for "logical extensions" to current reasoning in programming languages.
				Some current solutions and approaches will be debated pointing out their
				inability to solve problems in advanced programming topics such as
				concurrency. The speech will try to give a small but consistent overview of
				possible directions in reasoning about security at language level.

               <i>Runtime Visualisation Using Aspect-Oriented Programming
			   </i>
               <p>Runtime visualisation is a powerful, yet undervalued medium that can help manage 
			   the increasing complexity in software. It can be used for debugging, testing, 
			   profiling, and optimising software. Moreover, it proved to be a significant 
			   pedagogical tool. Seemingly, the reason behind its neglect is the difficulty of 
			   instrumenting programs for runtime information without introducing errors and 
			   large overheads. Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) offers a simple, elegant, and 
			   efficient solution to this problem.
			   <p>In this talk, I discuss the problems posed by some current approaches to program 
			   instrumentation for runtime visualisation, then introduce the aspect-oriented 
			   alternative. AspectJ is used to epitomise a few recurrent schemes. Time permitting, 
			   I will briefly demonstrate my proof-of-concept tool "Ara", a generic runtime 
			   visualisation tool for Java programs.

               <i>Modular Support Vector Machines for Time Series Forecasting 
			   </i>
               <p>Until now we have a great diversity of algorithms that let us solve diverse 
			   problems with Neural Networks in an accurate way, and the possibility of have 
			   a method to combine some them in a structure to be able to solve more than one 
			   problem sounds tantalizing. In this sense, this research will be based in the 
			   development of a meta-structure (a modified Modular Support Vector Machine) 
			   that let us solve several problems on the same field, in this case, the 
			   regression problem for Time Series forecasting. This algorithm will have two 
			   kinds of modules: a) modules able to solve more than one problem of the same 
			   class and b) modules focus to solve a unique task. It is expected to have 
			   modules able to collaborate among them to have a better solution or to solve 
			   another task of the same class. Then it will let us have a compact and 
			   incremental architecture. Better results are expected based in the improvement 
			   of Support Vector Machines over classical Neural Networks, i.e. the ill-posed 
			   problem.

               <i>Improving the Evolvability of Combinatorial Logic Circuits with Pseudo-Quantum Logic Gates
			   </i>
               <p>The evolution of combinatorial logic circuits is made difficult by the existence 
			   of large plateaus in the fitness landscape. Following an overview of combinatorial 
			   circuits, the standards for evolving them (representation, fitness, selection, etc), 
			   and a few specific algorithm as examples of research into this area, the field of 
			   quantum inspired algorithms is introduced, before a new algorithm for the evolution 
			   of combinatorial logic circuits is presented. By utilizing pseudo-quantum gates that 
			   are a super position of multiple conventional gates, a pseudo-quantum circuit 
			   represents a class of conventional circuits, and hence can use more global information 
			   about the search space from beyond the current plateau, to drive evolution.

               <i>Programming Languages for Interactive Computing
			   </i>
               <p>Traditional programming languages are algorithmic: they are best suited to writing programs 
			   that acquire all their inputs before executing and only produce a result on termination. By 
			   contrast most applications are interactive, in that they maintain ongoing interactions with 
			   their environments. Modern real-world systems address this incompatibility by embedding an 
			   event-driven state management scheme into the host language which dispatches fragments of 
			   imperative code in response to external events, the job of each executed fragment being to 
			   restore the internal consistency of the computation. The downside of this approach to 
			   interaction is that it relies heavily on mutable stores and side-effects and mixes 
			   application logic in with behaviour which is arguably the responsibility of an execution 
			   model. I propose an alternative programming model which supports interaction directly. The 
			   distinguishing feature of the model is its modal construal of state and interaction.

               <i>A Model of Light Propagation in the Tissues of the Oesophagus
			   </i>
               <p>Cancer of the oesophagus (gullet) has become the ninth most common cancer in adults 
			   in the United Kingdom. Unfortunately, early malignant tumours in the gullet cannot be seen 
			   with the naked eye and detection relies on conducting biopsies after the observation of 
			   abnormalities in the lining of the oesophagus. The random nature of this process implies 
			   that some early cancers may not be detected.
			   <p>This talk outlines a proposal for creating a physically realistic model of light 
			   propagation in the tissues of the oesophagus, which can later aid in the detection of 
			   gullet cancer. To this end, we will present the models used and describe some of the 
			   tools that might assist in the research process.

               <i>Churn Prediction 
			   </i>
               <p>CRM (Customer Relationship Management) is a popular topic in recent years. Especially 
			   in the fiercely competitive telecommunications market, it presents a great many challenges 
			   to providers of these services, but at the same time affords extraordinary opportunities 
			   to those providers who understand the market and, most importantly, the needs and wants 
			   of existing and potential customers. How to apply technical methods to help decision-making 
			   process and gain more profit during business is more and more important.  
			   <p>Churn Prediction is a typical CRM problem that many tele-companies are facing today. 
			   In this talk, I will introduce what churn prediction is and why we need it. Then, a common 
			   framework and popular modeling and optimization solutions will be discussed.

               <i>Human Face Detection and Recognition
			   </i>
               <p>Human face detection in still images has been researched extensively over the past 
			   decade, due to the recent emergence of applications such as security access control, visual 
			   surveillance and content-based information retrieval. How-ever, this problem remains 
			   challenging because faces are non-rigid objects that have a high degree of variability in 
			   size, shape, color and texture. In this presentation, I am going to introduce the major 
			   efforts carried out in this cumbersome research field. The presentation will outline the 
			   advantages and disadvantages of the different techniques used, the challenges faced, and 
			   the futures trends.
