</FONT>

<P>The task is to give a talk on the topic of your current research interests, using
a series of slides suitable for display via a laptop driven data projector.

<P><b>MSc Students</b> - the talk will be 10 minutes long, based on your first semester 
mini-project topic, and will take place in the last three weeks of the Autumn Term.

<P><b>PhD Students</b> - the talk will be 15 minutes long, based on your current PhD topic, 
and will take place in the first three weeks of the Spring Term.

<P>The audience for the talks will be the module lecturer (who will assess the talk),
the other students taking the <i>Research Skills</i> module, any staff who have an interest 
in particular talks, plus anyone else you wish to invite.  There will be time after each
presentation for questions, discussion and feedback.

<p>A short informative title and abstract must be emailed to the module lecturer 
(<A HREF="mailto:j.a.bullinaria@cs.bham.ac.uk">j.a.bullinaria@cs.bham.ac.uk</A>) at 
least <b>two working days before your talk</b>.

</ol>

<P>The <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~jxb/RS/RStimes.html"></a> detailed timetable for the talks will be published on the module web-site.  Failure to show up
