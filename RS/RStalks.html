               <i>A Brief Introduction to EEG-Based Brain-Computer Interfaces 
			   </i>
               <p>Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) can provide a link to the external world for those who 
			   lack the ability to use more traditional communications channels relying on motor skills. 
			   Electroencephalography (EEG) provides a non-invasive means of measuring the electrical 
			   activity of groups of neurons which can be analysed to detect the intent of users.
			   <p>This presentation seeks to introduce EEG-based brain-computer interfaces, providing 
			   an overview of relevant EEG characteristics and proposing techniques to detect the 
			   electrophysiological signatures of the intent of trained users.

               <i>Fitness Functions for Art 
			   </i>
               <p>Art has existed for thousands of years, from caveman's early paintings through 
			   to modern day art such as Tracey Emin's 'My Bed'. For many decades people have been 
			   trying to build computer systems that can create art. There are many systems 
			   around that create evolutionary art and have done so with a fair degree of success. 
			   However most of these current systems rely on a user to judge the quality of the 
			   art to help guide the evolution.
              <p>Surely this means the computer is still only a tool for the user who is still 
			  ultimately the artist? To have a computer which creates art means it must be able 
			  to judge the aesthetic quality of its own work and guide the evolution by itself w
			  ith no outside interaction.
              <p>Some work has been done in this area with varying degrees of success and their 
			  has been more success in the field of music, but can a computer ever truly judge 
			  a piece of art? Or will it always require a human to guide the evolution?

               <i>Local Search and Distribution of Optima
			   </i>
               <p>Local Search, also referred to as Neighborhood Search, is a widely used, 
			    general approach to solving hard optimization problems. In isolation, it is 
			    a simple iterative method for finding good approximate solutions - local optimum. 
			    A basic local search algorithm begins with an arbitrary solution and ends up in 
			    a local minimum where no further improvement is possible. Local optimum is the 
			    main problem with local search. Although these solutions may be of good quality,
			    they are not necessarily optimal.
				<p>Tabu search, belonging to the class of local search techniques, prevents 
				local search from getting trapped in a local optimum, hence increasing the 
				chances of hitting the global optimum.  Tabu Search approach, which is based 
				on a short-term memory (Tabu list), forces the algorithm to explore new areas 
				of the search space. However, there is always the risk of cycling if all the 
				escaping routes require constraint duration longer than the maximum number 
				of iterations. The number of local optima and the distribution of the local 
				optima in the search space therefore strongly influence the success of Tabu 
				search. The distribution of optimal points in a search space affects different 
				local search algorithms in different ways. This project will investigate this 
				relation by studying a number of optimisation problems and local search algorithms.  
				The well known 0-1 Knapsack Problem has been used for demonstrating the application 
				of different local search techniques. Similar analysis would be conducted on other 
				local search algorithms and optimisation problem at a later stage in the project.

			   </i>
               <p>Product manufacture in factories can be held back by inefficient floor-space 
			   management. Using nature-inspired or conventional techniques can help to optimise 
			   the layout of a factory floor, to improve the quality, productivity, and production 
			   time. Of particular interest is using evolutionary algorithms to tackle the problem.

			   Prediction Machines
			   </i>
               <p>Signal Peptides are sequences of typically between 15 and 30 amino
				acids found at the N-terminal part of a protein chain. These sequences
				act as a postcode for the protein, directing its transport within the
				cell. Once the protein has reached its destination the signal peptide
				is cleaved from the protein.
				<p>The signal peptide is an important feature for a number of bioscience
				fields, such as drug design, and the prediction of signal peptides has
				been a subject of much research. A number of techniques have been
				applied to this problem including weight matrices, hidden Markov
				models and neural networks.
				<p>This project explores the application of fractal prediction machines
				to the problem of predicting signal peptides and their cleavage
				positions.

               <i>Evaluating Java Genetic Algorithm Libraries 
			   </i>
               <p>Genetic algorithms are a promising area of research in the field of search 
			   optimization. By using evolutionary techniques such as mutation, crossover, 
			   and selection based on fitness, effective solutions to a problem can be 
			   "evolved" over numerous iterations of an algorithm. As a result, toolkits 
			   have emerged to facilitate the implementation of GAs in various languages, 
			   including Java. This project aims to identify and evaluate several leading 
			   Java toolkits designed for that purpose, on such criteria as simplicity, 
			   usability, efficiency, and customisability.

               <p>In humans, classification of an object is almost always invariant to its size, 
			   position and rotation despite the fact that even small transpositions of the object 
			   can result in massive changes in the retinal input. When building visual systems 
			   using neural networks it is important to include this invariance in any practical 
			   system. In this presentation we will see how Humans and simpler organisms obtain 
			   invariant recognition of objects. Solutions for neural network systems will also 
			   be proposed along with an example of how translational, scale and rotational 
			   invariance has been achieved in one particular face recognition system.

			   </i>
               <p>Cryptography is concerned with analysis of ciphers to discover methods 
			   to obtain the meaning of encrypted information. In this presentation I 
			   will give a brief introduction on Cryptanalysis and Cryptography. After 
			   that I will be talking about a cipher called RC5 and possible 
			   cryptanalysis techniques to attack this particular cipher.

               <i>Investigating the Scalability of Multi-Objective Evolutionary Algorithms
			   </i>
               <p>Multi-objective evolutionary algorithms (MOEAs) have received a lot of 
			   attention in the past, in the hope that they would enable the production of 
			   a diverse set of Pareto-optimal solutions in a single simulation run. There 
			   exists a number of different algorithms, most notably NSGA-II, SPEA2 and PAES, 
			   which have been created specifically to obtain such solutions efficiently. 
			   However, testing of these algorithms has been limited generally to the use 
			   of two or three objectives. In order to understand the algorithms and, more 
			   importantly, the limits to their applications better, the effects of adding 
			   more objectives as well as more decision variables will need to be studied 
			   more closely.

               <i>The Credibility of Evolutionary Artworks
			   </i>
               <p>In 1987 Richard Dawkins publicised his critically acclaimed "The Blind Watchmaker"
			   in which he presented the first evolutionary image generation system with his famous 
			   'Biomorphs' program. Since then the process of creating imagery through evolutionary 
			   techniques has become a field of natural computation in itself.
			   <p>The method has been adopted by artists and scientists alike and its artistic 
			   potential will be discussed, looking on examples of 'evolutionary artists', and 
			   critiquing their approaches. Finally possibilities to improve the artistic 
			   application of the technique will be considered.

               <i>Reference Extractor
			   </i>
               <p>Since the popularization of the internet, a style of information retrieving 
			   in a research seemed to have been changed by the development of the online 
			   services. There are a great number of online journal articles, papers, and 
			   the other academic resources, which can be published at institutions' level, 
			   publishers' level, and even a personal level. Because of this advantage of 
			   the resources, these online academic resources often enable researchers to 
			   access and find up-to-date information. However, online resources is not 
			   always organised and it might be difficult for researchers to collect the 
			   papers related each other in terms of a specific topic. Thus, reference 
			   linking has been obtaining a great attention and developed by many researchers 
			   to suggest efficient information retrieving style. The reference linking is 
			   to connect related research by association with reference sections of each 
			   academic paper. As one of the core issue of reference linking, reference 
			   extraction can be introduced. Reference extractor extracts a reference into 
			   metadata, such as authors' name, title, year of publication, to recognize 
			   related studies. Moreover, there appears to be many different approaches 
			   towards reference extraction. Therefore, in this research, each approach 
			   towards reference extraction will be compared and a reference extractor 
			   will be programmed referring to the approaches.
